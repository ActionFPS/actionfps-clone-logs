# Scala.js CLI demo

As a language, Scala is better than JavaScript.
 
However, JavaScript has better usability.
When's the last time you ran a Scala CLI app? Exactly.

So here I aim to demonstrate how to publish and use a CLI App written with Scala.js.

## Use the pre-built npmjs package

```
$ npm install -g scalajs-cli-demo
$ scalajs-cli-demo
Hello world!
```

## Building & publishing

```
$ npm run dist
$ npm publish
```
